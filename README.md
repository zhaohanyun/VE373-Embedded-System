# VE373-Embedded-System
This course studies MCU. When there's operating system, we write command. But here, we write bits.
We learnt clock, interrupt, ADC, serial communication, DMA, and I'm now able to use PIC32 and Stm32

The project is a comprehensive achivement of my junior. It composed of a vehicle and a visual system.

The vehicle part (/pic32) mainly involves how we control the modules with PIC32 MCU.

The visual system (/jetsion) works on Nividia Jetson, and runs facial recognition.

Together they allow the vehicle to follow certain person. (Although its reaction speed it not fast LOL)

Btw it has a beautiful appearance. It inherited the mechanical design used in the Engineering Training Competition, created by my teammate Chentao Zhu.
